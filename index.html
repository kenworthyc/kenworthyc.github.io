<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    I found the compare and contrast to be interesting. Both Phil and I self-identified as minimalist web design lovers; we started with a similar base aesthetic, but our blogs still needed basics to be outlined.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    Absolutely. I used a notebook, and seeing the shape of the website on the page helped me solidify exactly how many elements I wanted and what they were.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
    We share a minimalist aesthetic, and we agreed on the elements a blog post would really NEEDâ€” a title and text, with additional date/tag details if desired.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
    HMTL5 is a different ball game! The <article> and <details> tags were new to me, and <details> looks particularly fun and functional. <nav> is an excellent tag. It'll be odd to have so few divs going forward.
