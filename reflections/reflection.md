What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I understood pretty well the theory behind the padding/border/margin progression. Implementing the CSS gave me an actual feel for how much difference 10 pixels makes, or 10%, in the layout of a webpage.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

On a page that ended up as short and compact as mine, I learned that fixed positioning isn't as useful as I'd thought; in the interest of making the design more immediately readable and less complex,

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Adding in the background colors and widths to each of the main body elements was pretty easy, and that set up the frame of content pretty well.
By far the hardest thing was figuring out how to place the nav bar on the same level as my name, and then trying to make the links resize nicely. Didn't work out as well.
Putting my color scheme in to place was easy to perform, but I found it a serious time sink. (And after all that I don't think anyone will see the accent colors!) That gave me a reality check for the need to timebox.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned experientially about implementing floats; I have a much better idea of them now, rather than a sort of theory. (Clearing elements I need to work on.) I learned how useful classes or ids can be for troubleshooting CSS.
I was pleased with the relatively few changes I made on the blog.css file, as I think it means I understood the skeleton HTML enough to make it workable for a home page and content page. I'm not satisfied with the structure as is right now, but this CSS challenge gave me some confidence to continue to tinker.
