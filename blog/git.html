  <h1>Version Control, git, and GitHub</h1>

        Version control is a way for anyone to keep track of all the steps they've taken on a creative project on a computer. "Version control" is particularly popular with programmers, but it's an idea you may have come across as early as elementary school. If you ever had to turn in an outline for a short essay, then turn in a rough draft, and lastly a final version, you essentially broke a task down into parts, had copies of your work on each step, and then completed the task. When you're working on a computer, <b>version control makes it easy to track all your changes on a project</b>. It protects each stage, and lets you reference each change at any point.

    <h2>get on the git train</h2>
      <p>
        Version control is a method to record all your changes, edits, and versions of a project; git is a program that helps you do it. git organizes changes that you make on your project into different branches. The branch that you want to be as finalized as possible is called 'master'. But what about if you want to test out an idea without overwriting it to the finalized, 'master' branch? That's the beauty of branches on gitâ€” you can make one any time you like, test out all your changes, and if you approve them for the final version, you can merge your new, temporary branch with the master version.
      </p>
      <p>That's an overview of how git's software is structured to save all potential changes to a project. git is also incredibly good at tracking as many steps as you want on each branch of each project. When you want to track these steps with git, 3 things have to happen:
        <ol>
          <li>you make a change to a file</li>
          <li>stage the file to be committed</li>
          <li>commit the changes</li>
        </ol>
      When you commit the changes, your changes are saved by git using a unique commit number, so you can go back and find it forevermore.
