        <h1>Version Control, git, and GitHub</h1>

          <h2>rough drafts for programming</h2>
            <p>
              Version control is a way for anyone to keep track of all the steps they've taken on a creative project on a computer. "Version control" is particularly popular with programmers, but it's an idea you may have come across as early as elementary school. If you ever had to turn in an outline for a short essay, then turn in a rough draft, and lastly a final version, you essentially broke a task down into parts, had copies of your work on each step, and then completed the task. When you're working on a computer, version control makes it easy to track all your changes on a project. It protects each stage, and lets you reference each change at any point.
            </p>
          <h2>get on the git train</h2>
            <p>
              Version control is a method to record all your changes, edits, and versions of a project; git is a program that helps you do it. <strong>git organizes changes that you make on your project into different branches.</strong> The branch that you want to be as finalized as possible is called 'master'. But what about if you want to test out an idea without overwriting it to the finalized, 'master' branch? That's the beauty of branches on gitâ€” you can make one any time you like, test out all your changes, and if you approve them for the final version, you can merge your new, temporary branch with the master version.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's an overview of how git's software is structured to save all potential changes to a project. In addition git is also incredibly good at tracking as many steps as you want on each branch of each project. When you want to track these steps with git, 3 things have to happen:
            </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>you make a change to a file</li>
                  <li>you stage the file to be committed</li>
                  <li>you commit the changed file with a message describing the change</li>
                </ol>
            <p>
              "Staging a file" means adding it to a list to be included in the next commit. "Committing" means your changes are saved by git using a unique number, so you can go back and find that save point forevermore. That change is now saved (and you know why you made the change, thanks to the message).
            </p>
          <h2>the social coding network</h2>
            <p>
              So, git is a program on your computer that you can use to track changes. Thanks to so many people and programmers using it to track and protect their projects, a lot of them have wanted to get together to talk about it on the internet, and the place that they do that is called <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              GitHub is a website that you can use to upload your project as a backup, and you can share it with a community that can help you refine if you like. GitHub's social nature makes it possible for people all over the world to look at and access a project, which also makes it an incredibly powerful tool for collaboration.
