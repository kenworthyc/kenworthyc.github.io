  <h1>Enumerables and Enumerable#map</h1>

    <h2>what are Enumerables?</h2>
      <p>
        To start, let's go over what Enumerables aren't:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>not a type of object in Ruby (like strings, integers, or arrays)</li>
          <li>not just one method you can call on an object</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        You might notice that word "enumerable", in English, parses as an adjective. "Enumerables" (which you read about in the Ruby docs) is actually a short way of talking about a noun: "Enumerable classes." To reformulate: Enumerables are classes in Ruby which are <em>able to be enumerated</em>. Enumerables encompass a set of classes in Ruby, which respond to set of predefined methods (most of which have to do with enumerateing... or counting).
      </p>
      <p>So... what are Enumerables again?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an adjectival description of an object type which gathers smaller items (a 'collection class') in ruby</li>
          <li>an adjective for collection classes which get access to a set of methods</li>
          <li>those actions tend to count through the collection classes (e.g., enumerate them!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now we'll look at one example of a method which Enumerables get to use.</p>
    <h2>Enumerable#map and Enumerable#collect</h2>
      <p>
        Note: since Enumerables use limited list of methods, the header above an example of how you'd signify a general Enumerable method, rather than the specific destructive or non-destructive versions (<code>.map!</code> or <code>.map</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>.map</code> or <code>.collect</code> method iterates through each distinct member of a collection and alters each one. (The two methods are synonyms; you could use either if it makes your code more readable.) <code>.map</code> or <code>.collect</code> output is an array.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>.map</code> is excellent at taking an array and applying a new instruction to transform it. Of course, you have to provide the instruction in a code block (much as for <code>.each</code>). Here's an example:
      </p>
        <code>
          arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d"] <br/>
          => ["a", "b", "c", "d"] <br/>
          arr.map { |letter| letter.upcase } <br/>
          => ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
        </code>
      <p>
        It's good to note that although <code>.each</code> acts the same way as <code>.map</code>, their outputs differ; <code>.each</code> more easily gathers information from an array, where as <code>.map</code> is better suited to altering the array.)
