  <h1>Creating Objects in Ruby: Classes</h1>
  <h4>11.28.2015</h4>
  <article>
    <h2>have some class</h2>
      <p>
        In Ruby, classes let you define various limits and behaviors of an Object you want to create. (Building on an understanding of methods in Ruby: classes contain certain methods that are useful to call on a kind of object, and those methods can interact to perform complex actions using one method call.) Classes look like this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
      class Wallet
        # necessary methods and variables go here
      end
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        (In Ruby, class names are capitalized to distinguish them from variables or other objects.) Using the empty class above, let's make a smart-wallet. What would be some actions it'll need to, or kinds of useful information to display?
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>add or remove a card</li>
          <li>display relevant information about each card</li>
          <li>display the number of cards (to see if one was lost)</li>
          <li>the ability to add or spend cash</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Those are pretty good skills to teach our newfangled smart-wallet. Translated into Ruby, the 'add a card' instance method might look something like this:
      </p>
      </p>
      <pre><code>
      class Wallet

        def add_card(type_of_card_str, cardholder_str, card_num, exp_date_str)
            list_of_cards = []

            new_card = {
            Card: type_of_card_str,
            Cardholder: cardholder_str,
            Number: card_num,
            Expiration: exp_date_str
            }

            list_of_cards << new_card
        end

      end
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Nice! We start with an empty array for our list of cards, and the template for each card is a hash containing the pertinent information.
        <br/>
        But... hang on a minute. All the variables we've learned about so far (like <code>list_of_cards</code>) can't act both inside <em>and</em> outside methods. What about the other method, where we want to display <code>list_of_cards</code>?
      </p>
    <h2>instance variables save the daaaay</h2>
      <p>
        In a normal Ruby method, a variable would be totally helpless here. Luckily, Ruby has special dispensations for classes. <strong>Instance variables</strong> are just like regular variables, but they're available inside and outside every method within a class. They're designated with an @. Now, with instance variables, we can do this!
      </p>
      <pre><code>
      class Wallet

          def add_card(type_of_card_str, cardholder_str, card_num, exp_date_str)
            @list_of_cards = []

            new_card = {
            card: type_of_card_str,
            cardholder: cardholder_str,
            number: card_num,
            expiration: exp_date_str
            }

            @list_of_cards << new_card
          end

          def display
            @list_of_cards.each do |card|
                card.each { |k, v|
                  puts "#{k}: #{v}"
                }
            end
          end

        end
      </code></pre>
      <p>
         Now the <code>display</code> method can access the <code>@list_of_cards</code> array to show all the cards we have. <code>Add</code> and <code>display</code> methods done!
      </p>
      <p>
        Try declaring an instance variable for <code>cash</code>, and including it in the <code>display</code> method. Then keep going and make methods to add cash, spend it, or count it!
